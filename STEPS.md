# Project: Event Planning and Booking System

## Project Overview
Create an Event Planning and Booking System where users can register, log in, create events, and book events. This project covers user authentication, RESTful APIs, CRUD operations, database integration, and a responsive frontend using React and Bootstrap.

## Features

### User Authentication
- User registration and login
- Password hashing
- Token-based authentication

### Event Management
- Create, read, update, and delete events
- Event details: title, description, date, location, available seats

### Booking Management
- Users can book available events
- Users can view and cancel their bookings

### Database Integration
- Store user, event, and booking data using MongoDB

### Responsive Frontend Interface
- Use Bootstrap for a modern, responsive UI
- Forms for user interactions (registration, login, event creation, booking)
- Use React for a dynamic and interactive user experience

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Bootstrap

## Steps to Complete the Project

### Set Up the Project
1. Initialize a new Node.js project.
2. Install necessary packages: `express`, `mongoose`, `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, `body-parser`.
3. Initialize a new Vite project for React.

### Set Up Express Server
1. Create a basic server and connect it to MongoDB.

### Implement User Authentication
1. Create user model with fields for username, email, and password.
2. Implement routes for user registration and login.
3. Use `bcrypt` for password hashing.
4. Generate and verify JWT for authentication.

### Implement Event Management
1. Create event model with fields for title, description, date, location, and available seats.
2. Implement routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting events.
3. Protect routes with JWT middleware to ensure only authenticated users can create or manage events.

### Implement Booking Management
1. Create booking model with references to user and event.
2. Implement routes for booking events, viewing bookings, and canceling bookings.
3. Ensure users can only book available seats and cannot book the same event multiple times.

### Develop Frontend Interface with React
1. Initialize a new React project using Vite.
2. Design a responsive UI using Bootstrap.
3. Create components for user registration, login, event creation, and booking.
4. Use Axios (or Fetch API) to interact with the backend API.
5. Implement state management with React hooks (useState, useEffect) or context API.

### Test and Debug
1. Test all routes and functionalities using tools like Postman.
2. Ensure proper error handling and validation.
3. Test the frontend to ensure it interacts correctly with the backend.

## Project Deliverables

### Backend
- Express server setup with connected MongoDB.
- Routes for user authentication, event management, and booking management.

### Frontend
- Responsive UI using React and Bootstrap.
- Components and pages for user registration, login, event management, and booking.

### Documentation
- API documentation.
- Setup and installation guide.
- User guide for the frontend interface.

## Extensions and Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- Add event categories and filtering options.
- Implement notifications for upcoming events.
- Add user roles with different permissions (e.g., admin, organizer, attendee).

### Frontend Enhancements
- Enhance UI/UX with additional Bootstrap components and custom styles.

### Deployment
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.
- Set up CI/CD for automated deployments.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand user authentication and authorization.
- Create RESTful APIs with Express.js.
- Perform CRUD operations with MongoDB and Mongoose.
- Develop a responsive frontend using React and Bootstrap.
- Integrate frontend and backend to create a full-stack application.

## Setup Guide for Frontend with React and Vite

### Initialize Vite Project
```sh
npm create vite@latest my-event-app --template react
cd my-event-app
npm install
